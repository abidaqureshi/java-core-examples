Java interface in Depth
 - What is Interface and how to define
 - Why we need Interface
 - Methods in Interface
 - Fields in a Interface
 - Interface Implementation
 - Nested Interface
 - Difference between Interface and Abstract class.

 Java 8 interface features:
 --------------------------
 - Default Method
  - How to handle the use-case when, Class implements multiple interfaces have same for the default method
  - static method
  - Functional interface

 Java 9 interface features
 ---------------------------
  - Private method

  What is Interface
  --------------------
  Interface is something which provides a way of interact with each other without exposing their details

  Or in simple it helps achieve ABSTRACTION.

  How to define the interface?
  ----------------------------
  Interface declaration consist of
  - Modifiers
  - "interface" keyword
  - Interface Name
  - Comma separated list of parent interfaces
  - Body
  - Interface will be default or Public but never Private or Protected

Why we need interface
-----------------------
Interface are used to tell a class what it must do but not how to do it.

Polymorphism
--------------
- Interface can be used as a Data type
- We cannot create the object of the interface, but it holds the reference of the classes who
implements it, And at run time it decide which method to invoke thats why its called dynamic polymorphism

Multiple Inheritance
----------------------
Multiple inheritance is only possible through interfaces

Methods in Interface
---------------------
- All methods are implicit public only
- Methods cannot be declare final

Fields in Interface
--------------------------
- Fields are implicitly public , static and final which are (CONSTANTS)
- You cannot make field private in interface

Interface implementation
--------------------------
- Overriding method cannot have more restrictive access modifier ( Can't go public to protected or private in c
lass who implementing it.
- Concrete class must override all the methods declared in Interface
- Abstract classes are not forced to implement all the methods of implemented interface
- A class can implement from multiple interfaces

Nested Interface
==============
- Nested interface declared within another Interface
- Nested interface declared within a class
Generally its used to group, logical related interfaced, and Nested interface

Rules:
 - A nested interface declared withing an interface must be public
 - A nested interface declared within a class can have any access modifier
 - When you implement outer interface, inner interface implementation is not required and visa versa.
 - You can define an interface within a class as private/protected or public ( A class ostrich is an example of it )
