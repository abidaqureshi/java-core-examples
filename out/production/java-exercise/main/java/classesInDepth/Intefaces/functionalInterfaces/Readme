What is functional interface
-------------------------------
- If an interface contains only 1 abstract method, that is known as functional interface
- Its also called SAM ( Single Abstract Method )
- Functional interface annotation (@functionalInterface) is used to mark the interface as functional and
it throws exception if another abstract Method defined. It restrict us to have only one abstract method
- Functional interface may have default and static methods or method inherited from the other class

What is Lambda Expression?
- Lambda Expression is a way to implement functional interface
- There are different ways of implement functional interface
- Using "implements"
- Using "anonymous Class"
- Using Lambda expression
---------------------------

Types of functional interface?

- Consumer
--------------
--> Represent an operation, that accepts a single input parameter and
return no result
--> Present in package: java.util.function
---------------------
- Supplier
--> Represent the supplier of the result
--> Accepts no input parameter but produce a result
--> present in package java.util.function
----------------------
- Function
--> Represent function, that accepts one
argument process it and product result
--> present in package java.util.function
------------------
- Predicate
--> Represent a function that take a single argument and
return the boolean.
--> present. java.util.function

How to handle usecase when a functional interface extends from another interface?
----------------------------------------------------
UseCase 1: Functional interface does not extend Non functional interface because a functional interface can have
only single abstract method. ( e.g LivingThing Interface and Bird Interface )
- It can only extends the non functional interface if it has default or static method. (e.g Bird and FlyingThing )
- If both functional interface has the same method to override then they can extend each other ( e.g PeaCock and Fowl )
