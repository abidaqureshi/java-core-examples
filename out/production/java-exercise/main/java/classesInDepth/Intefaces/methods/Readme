1.Java 8 and Java 9 Features
1. Default Method ( Java 8 )
- Before Java 8 interface can only have abstract method. and all child classes has to provide abstract method implementation
- Any new method added in interface means need to change its implementation to all child classes.
- To add functionality in existing Legacy interface we need to use Default method.
- If a class implements two interfaces having same default method then class must override that method and provide its
implementation e.g (Bird, LivingThing, Sparrow )
- If a interface extends from another interface having a default method then it does not need to provide its implementation, like wise
class implementing those interface doesn't need to override that method
e.g ( Bird, Hawk, WhiteHawk )
- If an interface extends from another interface inheriting a default method to abstract then the implementing class must
override it. ( Mamal, LandMamal, Wolf)
- If an interface extends from another interface inheriting a default method can also override it by using its parent implementation
or provide its own implementation ( Bird, Hawk )

2. Public Static Method (Java8)
--------------------------
- We can provide the implementation of the method in interface
- But it can not be overridden by classes which implement the interface
- We can access it using Interface name itself
- Its by default public

3. Private Method and Private Static method only available in ( Java 9 ) example Hipo Interface
---------------------------------------------------------
- We can provide the implementation of method but as private access modifier in interface
- It brings more readability of the code. For example if multiple default method share some code, that this can help
- It can be defined as static and non-static
- From static method, we can call only private static interface method.
- Private static method, can be called from both static and non static method.
