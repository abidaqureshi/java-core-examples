What is Java Collections Framework?

- Added in Java version 1.2
- Collections is nothing but a group of objects
- Present in java.util package
- Framework provide us the architecture to manage these "group of object" i.e add, update, delete, search etc

Why we need Java collections framework?

- Prior to JCF, we have Array, Vector, Hash tables
- But Problem with that is, we don't have common interface which provide methods to invoke on collections so its difficult
to remember those methods.

Iterable: Used to traverse the collection

Queue:
- Queue is an interface, child of an collection interface
- Generally Queue follow FIFO method yet there is an exception priorityQue
- Supports all methods available in Collection + some other methods mentioned below.

Priority Que:
- Priority is of two types, Minimum Priority Que and Maximum priority Que
- Its uses heap behind its implementation ( min heap and max heap )
- Elements are ordered according to either Natural order ( default)  or by Comparator provided during queue
construction time.

Time complexity
Add and Offer: O(logn)
Peak: O(1)
Poll and remove head element: O(logn)
Remove arbitrary element: O(n)
